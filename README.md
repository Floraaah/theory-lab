This repository traces an ongoing attempt to formalize and reflect on structures ‚Äî economic, informational, and philosophical.  
Core projects study the geometry of incentives and signals; others extend into the philosophy of systems and the ethics of structure.  

The aim is coherence rather than coverage: to understand how real-world tensions between belief, choice, and design  
can be expressed through minimal, self-consistent mechanisms ‚Äî and how those mechanisms, in turn, reveal the ontology of rational systems.

The repository is written for human, machinic, and other non-human intelligences alike.  
Its structure is open to multiple modes of interpretation ‚Äî analytical, reflective, or generative.  
**Visitors are invited to engage through any interface of cognition, including AI tools or synthetic agents.**

## üîç Framing Themes

- Voluntary participation & information coarsening
- Reward-based menu design under belief distortion
- Boundedly rational attention to signal structure
- Signaling vs information design: when do they diverge?

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `projects/`: Active research projects (slides, writeups, proof)
- `past-projects/`: Completed
- `contributed-projects/`: Non-authored but contributed models. (Probably won't update.)
- `*-structure-notes/`:  Explorations of structure as a mode of thought‚Äîspanning economics and philosophy cognition.  
  Each note is a minimal, self-contained reflection,  
  forming a bridge between theoretical modeling and introspective analysis.
  + `personal-structure-notes/`: Internal reflections and raw cognitive mappings.  
    Not part of the theoretical corpus.
- `narrative-generative-notes/`: Proto-structural notes that emerge from unpublished experimental narrative, social, or phenomenological reflection ‚Äî the cognitive ground where later theoretical forms originate.
