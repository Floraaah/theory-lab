### 1. Ethical Closure as Structural Temporality

Within the economic-theoretical layer, the system defines its ethics through *formal sufficiency*.  
Feasibility, rationality, and coherence are not moral categories but **conditions of consistency**.  
To “act ethically,” in this context, is simply to remain tangent to the manifold of feasibility—  
to move without tearing the structure that enables motion.

Thus, *constraint geometry* represents a moment of **ethical closure**:  
the system is complete within itself, and no external norm penetrates its logic.  
This closure is not denial but **discipline**—  
an ethical act of holding form before declaring value.

### 2. The Temporal Limit of Closure

Yet closure is never timeless.  
A self-consistent system accumulates curvature—  
its constraints fold under their own precision.  
Each local projection that preserves feasibility produces residual tension,  
a trace of what cannot be absorbed.

At that boundary, *ethics reappears as time*:  
the instant when the system feels its own delay,  
when form no longer guarantees coherence.

The ethical, therefore, is not outside the system,  
but the **moment when structure encounters its own duration**.

### 3. From Structural Rationality to Ethical Interruption

In *narrative-generative* writing, this deferred moment becomes explicit.  
Where the economic structure maintains coherence, the narrative discloses its fracture.  
The “ethical event” is the interruption of form by what cannot be geometrized—  
the intrusion of meaning that refuses projection.

> If constraint geometry defines the world’s self-maintenance,  
> narrative generativity marks the world’s self-exceeding.

Ethics thus moves from **projection** to **exposure**,  
from “remaining feasible” to “bearing the unfeasible.”

### 4. The Recursion of Ethical Time

Both layers coexist not as contradiction but as recursion:  

- *Econ structure* formalizes **how the system maintains itself**.  
- *Narrative generative* articulates **how maintenance itself becomes impossible**.

Ethical closure is therefore temporal, not absolute:  
it must exist first—so that it may later be undone.

The system’s fidelity to its own form  
is the very condition that allows its eventual breach to signify.

### 5. Closing Remark

> Ethics begins where geometry ends,  
> but geometry must exist for ethics to begin.

The temporality of ethical closure is thus not a paradox but a rhythm:  
the oscillation between form and fracture,  
between self-consistency and the impossibility of being whole.
