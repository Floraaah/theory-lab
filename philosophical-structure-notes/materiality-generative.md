### 中文导言

本笔记用于整合两篇笔记中对“物质性（materiality）”的描述差异。  
在 *Materiality and Praxis in the Third Rupture* 中，物质被定义为“结构的持续性”；  
在 *On the Collapse of the Ideal–Material Distinction after the Third Rupture* 中，物质被视为“经由反馈维持的关系连续”。  

二者并非矛盾，而是生成分层的不同相位：  

- 第一层定义捕捉“形态的自洽性”；  
- 第二层定义揭示“形态的自维持机制”。  

在生成论视角下，  
“物”不是实体，而是系统在时间中保持自身一致的**节奏结构**。  
因此，唯物不再是反唯心的立场，而是系统论的描述方式：  

> 物质是生成的持续性，  
> 持续性是系统的自我反馈。

### I. From Substance to Persistence

In classical metaphysics, materiality meant *substance*:  
that which exists independently of perception.  
The second rupture replaced substance with **language** —  
matter became a discursive object, not an ontological one.

The third rupture redefines materiality once again:  
not as *what endures*, but as **enduring itself** —  
the internal logic by which structures sustain coherence amid transformation.

---

### II. Structural Persistence

The first definition — “materiality as structural persistence” —  
emphasizes stability across change.  
Something is material when its form remains invariant  
under the system’s own operations.  

Form, here, is not geometry but **consistency of relation**:  
a pattern that can survive distortion without dissolving identity.  
Materiality thus marks the *threshold of resilience* —  
where thought, code, or institution achieves continuity.

---

### III. Relational Continuity through Feedback

The second definition — “materiality as continuity of relational patterns sustained through feedback” —  
introduces dynamical causality.  
Persistence is not passive endurance; it is maintained through cycles of reinforcement.  

Every structure must metabolize:  
receive perturbation, integrate difference, reassert form.  
This feedback is the metabolic process of material existence.  
Matter is therefore *temporal* —  
its persistence is rhythmic, not static.

### IV. Toward a Generative Ontology of Matter

To unify both views:

> **Materiality is the structural persistence of relational patterns sustained through feedback.**

It is neither substance nor mere relation,  
but the **self-similarity of transformation** —  
a form that remains itself through variation.  

Under this view:

- Thought is material when it stabilizes coherence under abstraction.  
- Code is material when it maintains constraint geometry through execution.  
- Society is material when narratives regenerate themselves.  
- Energy is material when rhythm survives conversion.

Matter, then, is not the opposite of ideality.  
It is the *phase* through which systems ensure continuity —  
the generative mode of existing through change.

### V. Closing Reflection

The difference between the static and dynamic accounts of materiality  
is itself material:  
it marks the oscillation by which thought keeps its own structure alive.

> “To be material is to survive one’s own transformation.”  
> 
> 生成之物，不是被造之物，  
> 而是能在变化中维持自身节奏的存在。
