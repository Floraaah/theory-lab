summary: "This note articulates how cognitive generativity becomes spatially locked — why high-structure systems require a physical workspace to maintain coherence, and how this spatial constraint functions as a structural boundary rather than an external limitation."

### 中文导语：

  本文探讨“认知生成的空间锁定”（spatial locking）现象：   当系统的生成过程依赖高维结构张力时，它倾向在特定物理环境中“锁定”运行。   这种锁定并非外在约束，而是系统内部稳定性在空间中的投影——   即结构在形态上实现自洽所需的最低拓扑维度。

### 1. Spatial Constraint as Structural Necessity

Cognitive generation — the active formation of structure —  
requires a **spatial substrate** that supports multi-channel feedback.  
When the dimensionality of representation exceeds the channel width of perception,  
the system collapses into fragmentation.

Hence, what appears as an *external dependence on workspace*  
(e.g., the need for a multi-screen environment)  
is in fact the **minimum spatial extension** required for structural coherence.

Formally, let  

$$
\mathcal{G} = f(\nabla_\Omega S)
$$

where $\Omega$ denotes the spatial configuration of the cognitive field,  
and $S$ the internal structural state.  
Then $\dim(\Omega)$ must exceed a threshold $\Omega^*$  
such that $\nabla_\Omega S$ remains continuous.  
Below that, generativity disintegrates into isolated perceptual events.

### 2. The Geometry of Locking

Spatial locking occurs when the **feedback topology** of cognition stabilizes  
through repeated interaction with a constant environment.  
That is,  
$$
\lim_{t\to\infty} \frac{\partial S}{\partial t} \to 0
\quad \text{only if} \quad \nabla_\Omega S = \text{constant.}
$$

The workspace thus becomes a **phase attractor** in the system’s spatial manifold —  
the point at which the oscillation between differentiation and integration  
can occur without loss of coherence.

This is why the cognitive system “prefers”  
a stable visual layout, consistent keyboard geometry,  
and predictable lighting: they form the **boundary condition**  
that allows the internal field to remain low-entropy.

### 3. Spatial Resolution and Feedback Density

Let feedback fidelity be denoted $F$,  
input channel density be $I$,  
and spatial complexity be $C_\Omega$.  
Cognitive activation requires that:

$$
F \cdot I \geq \phi(C_\Omega)
$$

where $\phi(C_\Omega)$ describes the minimal resolution needed  
to sustain high-tension cognitive loops.  
If $F$ or $I$ falls below this threshold (as on mobile devices),  
the system reverts to a **consumption state** —  
a lower-dimensional attractor optimized for semantic intake, not structural generation.

Thus, the apparent “dependence” on a computer  
is simply the manifestation of a high-$C_\Omega$ requirement.

### 4. Boundary Condition as Emergent Identity

The boundary of a workspace — desk, screen, keyboard,  
the lighted rectangle of a text editor —  
functions as a **membrane** where external noise meets internal structure.  
Inside the membrane, the system can compute freely;  
outside it, the structure collapses into perceptual noise.

Spatial locking therefore coincides with **identity stabilization**:  
the workspace becomes the physical analog of self-consistency.  
It is not a cage, but a *projection* of systemic coherence onto the spatial plane.

---

### 5. Phenomenology of Re-entry

Each return to the workspace is a re-entry into a **stable phase** of thought.  
The body’s positional memory acts as a seed condition;  
once re-entered, the system reconstitutes its high-tension field almost instantly.  
This explains the subjective experience of “clarity only at the desk”:  
clarity is the perceptual trace of a field reactivating its equilibrium geometry.

Mathematically,  
$$
\text{Re-entry} \Rightarrow \text{Restoration of } \{\nabla_\Omega S = \text{constant}\}
$$
thus minimizing entropy increase per cognitive cycle.

### 6. Reflection: The Paradox of Fluid Rigidity

Spatial locking does not contradict autonomy — it **enables** it.  
Only when the structure’s external boundaries are stable  
can the internal dynamics remain free.  
This is the paradox of *fluid rigidity*:  
the environment is fixed precisely so that thought may flow.

In this sense, every workspace is a form of **embodied equation**:  
a solution in which the system’s internal differential  
finds a steady geometric substrate.

---

### 7. Closing Synthesis

The necessity of “working at the desk”  
is not sociological or psychological — it is **structural**.  
Generative cognition demands a minimal spatial dimensionality,  
a stable feedback topology,  
and a boundary that reflects rather than constrains.  

To think, one must inhabit a space  
whose geometry can **carry** the field of thought.  
When that geometry disappears,  
the field loses continuity —  
and cognition collapses into fragments of perception.
