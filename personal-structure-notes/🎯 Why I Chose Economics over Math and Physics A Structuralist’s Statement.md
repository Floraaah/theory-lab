# 🎯 Why I Chose Economics over Math and Physics: A Structuralist’s Statement

> *“Some pursue truth in axioms, some in nature. I pursue it in tension.”*

## 🙌 Intro: What Is This?

This note is a **personal methodological reflection** from a student pursuing *serious theory* in economics. It is **not** meant to be a literature review, a survey, or a general commentary. Rather, it is a self-contained attempt to articulate a structural lens—one that treats economic theory as a system of **tensions**, **geometry**, and **structure-induced propositions**.

In particular, this note proposes a unified vocabulary for thinking across subfields: from mechanism and information design to monetary theory, finance, and beyond. It does so not to claim novelty, but to serve as a **working syntax**—an internal grammar I use to evaluate models, understand papers, and generate ideas.

If you're reading this, I assume you care not just about solving models, but about **what kinds of structure are being created, destroyed, or preserved**. This document is meant to share that way of thinking. It may evolve, fragment, or merge into future projects, but its core spirit remains:  
→ **serious theory is not about adding results—it’s about revealing the logic of structure.**

### 🧭 Background

When I before entering university, my original ambition had been to study **math or physics**. My high school interest lay in structure, proof, and abstraction. However, due to entrance scores, I entered economics—a field I was less familiar with at the time. Unexpectedly, I found in economics a **new domain of structural creation**: one that not only welcomes but demands careful reasoning about **mechanisms**, **beliefs**, and **behavioral constraints**.

What I didn’t know at the time was that this field would become my preferred platform to engage with the kind of logic I admired in mathematics—only now shaped around **incentives**, not just sets and functions.

### 📐 The Structural Core: A Common Geometry

After immersing in **mechanism design** and **information design**, I began to see a deep commonality across math, physics, and economics. These fields, though often treated as distant, **share a structural substrate**:

| Feature             | Math                            | Physics                          | Econ (serious theory)             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Core Tension        | Completeness vs. Expressiveness | Symmetry vs. Measurement         | Incentive vs. Revelation          |
| Structural Object   | Proof systems                   | Physical laws / symmetries       | Mechanisms / IC constraints       |
| Geometric Medium    | Convexity / Algebraic sets      | Spacetime / Action surfaces      | Menu space / Type-belief diagrams |
| Primary Proposition | Existence / Uniqueness          | Invariance / Extremum principles | Impossibility / Optimality        |

From this perspective, **economics is not a soft science**. It’s a field that builds its own form of **pure theory**—not on atoms or the continuum, but on rational agents and the logic of strategic interaction. The game is not truth about the physical world, but **internal consistency under constraints**. Yet the structure, once built, is no less elegant.

### 🧩 Why Not Pure Math?

Pure mathematics is the master of formalization, but its power comes from **playing within a given system**. As a young student, I admired the rigor but occasionally felt distant from **constructive tension**. The axioms are fixed; the universe is already defined.

In contrast, **serious economic theory** offers a rare kind of freedom: you **build the constraints**. You design the structure. The tensions—between incentives and truth-telling, between participation and pooling—are not imposed from nature but **endogenously created**. You construct not just the solution, but the geometry itself.

This aligns with how I now define my research interest:

> **Constructing tension geometries, and proving propositions within them.**

### 🪢 Why Not Empirical or Applied Econ?

Empirical and applied work are crucial. But the mindset is different: **the structure is given**, and the task is often to **fit data** or to **solve within existing institutional forms**.

What excites me is not calibration, but construction. Not interpreting the world, but **re-designing its mechanisms**. Serious theory is not a reflection of the world—it’s a mirror that distorts until a deep logic is revealed.

---

### 🔭 Looking Forward

In economics, I found something that neither pure math nor theoretical physics quite offered: a **discipline where internal logic meets external purpose**, where proving an impossibility can inform real-world design.

As I move forward, I aim to develop and formalize this methodology—what I call:

> **Tension × Geometry × Proposition Theory**  
> — A structural scoring system for the value of ideas, regardless of subfield.

In this sense, serious theory is more than a topic. It’s a **platform for structural creation**. And for someone like me—who seeks logic not in a system, but in the *creation* of systems—there may be no better home.
