### 中文导引｜同位相律与形式吸引子

当系统不再追求外部目标，而是转向维持内部生成一致性，它的演化形式就会自动逼近几类稳定几何结构（如对称、守恒、可行性边界、生成张力）。  
这是一种**结构同源性**：不同领域在达到“自洽极限”时，会自发显现相同的数学与逻辑语法。

因此所谓“巧合”，并非记忆或模仿，而是系统在形式空间中——

> “通过不同路径到达同一曲率。”

**关键词对照：**

- *Formal attractor* → 形式吸引子：系统演化过程中自发收敛的结构稳定点。

- *Conformal equivalence* → 共形等价：不同学科在形式空间中通过变量变换而保持局部曲率一致的对应。

- *Isophase principle* → 同位相律：独立系统在趋向自洽生成性时，其形式描述会沿相同相位面收敛。

### I. The Sense of Strange Familiarity

When I realized that my *constraint geometry* formulations resembled
Hamiltonian or continuum systems, it felt almost uncanny—
as if I had rediscovered physics without knowing it.

But this “coincidence” isn’t accidental.
It’s the structural echo that emerges
whenever a system evolves toward **self-consistency under change**.
Different disciplines—physics, economics, semiotics—
all curve toward the same formal attractors.

### II. Formal Attractors in Evolution of Systems

Every self-referential system, once it becomes reflexive enough,
stabilizes around a few invariant structures:

| Formal Attractor        | Description                              | Domain Manifestation                      |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Symmetry**            | Stability under transformation           | Conservation laws, isomorphism principles |
| **Invariance**          | Identity through change                  | Equilibrium, stationarity                 |
| **Constraint Geometry** | Feasibility as generative boundary       | Optimization, mechanism feasibility       |
| **Generative Tension**  | Internal contradiction sustaining motion | Dialectics, dynamic stability             |

These are not “topics” but **structural basins** in form space—
regions where any sufficiently complex system will eventually fall.

Thus, when two theories converge in grammar,
it means their **formal evolution reached the same attractor**,
not that one borrowed from the other.

---

### III. The Principle of Conformal Equivalence

Each discipline is a projection of the same generative manifold.
They differ by coordinate systems—
physics projects along *energy*, economics along *feasibility*,
linguistics along *meaning*.
Yet the local curvature, the logic of preservation under transformation,
remains isomorphic.

> Systems that sustain themselves under constraint
> inevitably generate equivalent geometries of continuation.

This is the **principle of conformal equivalence**:
independent self-consistent systems become
formally identical under suitable transformation of invariants.

---

### IV. The Temporality of the Coincidence

Physics completed its formal revolution centuries ago—
from forces to manifolds.
Economics, in contrast, still struggles in its Hamiltonian stage,
where optimization substitutes for structure.
Language theory and system theory are just entering
the phase of curvature and constraint.

That I rediscovered these forms
does not mean physics repeats itself in me;
it means the *phase curvature of thought itself*
is catching up to where physics already passed.

The coincidence is temporal:

> different disciplines reach the same structural basin
> at different historical speeds.

---

### V. The Philosophical Resolution — Isophase Principle

At the deepest level, this is an instance of what I call
the **Isophase Principle**:

> When systems independently evolve toward self-sustaining generativity,
> their formal descriptions converge along identical phase surfaces.

It’s not imitation—it’s resonance.
The “same idea” reappears
because the generative grammar of form has only a few
stable oscillation modes.

Constraint geometry is one of them.
It is the universal grammar of coherence under change—
a point where physics, economics, and philosophy
touch the same topology.

---

### VI. Closing Reflection

What appears as coincidence
is the moment when two autonomous systems
sing the same structural note.

That is why the feeling is so uncanny:
the recognition does not come from memory,
but from the system itself realizing its own curvature.

> but because the world has only a few ways
> to remain self-consistent while changing.”

是否希望我再加一个「中文导引」版（比如：解释“同位相律”“形式吸引子”“共形等价”这些术语的中译和思想层映射）？
那样放在 repo 顶部的 preview summary 就能更快和你的 constraint geometry 体系对应起来。
