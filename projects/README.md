# Projects

This folder hosts active and archival **formal research projects** in microeconomic theory.  
Each project corresponds to a self-contained modeling inquiry, complete with  
definitions, lemmas, and mechanism constructions.

The focus is on **constraint-driven modeling** rather than story-driven motivation:  
models are treated as *tests of structural coherence*, not as empirical hypotheses.

### Project Typology

1. **Structural Mechanism Design** — exploring feasibility and equilibrium under structural constraints.  
2. **Information and Learning Models** — analyzing belief dynamics, regret, and obsolescence.  
3. **Participation-based Objectives** — using endogenous inclusion as a proxy for welfare or stability.

### Relationship to Notes

Theoretical notes in `econ-structure-notes/` articulate the structural intuition;  
projects in this folder instantiate those intuitions into formal models.  
The two layers together constitute the **serious theory pipeline**:  
from abstract framing → to mechanism construction → to potential publication.

### Style and Standards

All projects follow minimal formal notation,  
LaTeX structure compatible with journal submission format,  
and maintain independence from storytelling or policy framing.

> **Core principle:** structural tension precedes optimization.  
> The model is valid only insofar as its constraint geometry is irreducible.
