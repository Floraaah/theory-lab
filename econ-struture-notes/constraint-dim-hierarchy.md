### 中文导引

这篇笔记定义了**约束流的维度层级**。  
它将宏观层面的“可行性结构的变形”（Aghion–Acemoglu 极限）与微观层面的“张力的自维持”（Generative Labor 极限）统一到同一几何框架之中。  
在这一结构下，生成性伦理不再外置于系统，而成为 constraint geometry 内部的延拓。

核心命题：

> “系统的可持续性在于维持可行性；  
> 伦理的内生性在于维持维持的可行性。”

关键词对照：

- **约束流（constraint flow）** → 系统演化的可行几何

- **生成性张力（generative tension）** → 伦理端点的局部动力

- **宏观极限** → 可行性结构的变形

- **微观极限** → 张力的持续与再调

- **维度层级（dimensional hierarchy）** → 几何与伦理的对偶展开

# **Dimensional Hierarchy of Constraint Flows**

### 1  Constraint Flow as Geometric Process

Let $\mathcal F$ be the manifold of feasible configurations $A$.
A constraint flow is a trajectory $A_t$ such that

```math
\dot A_t \in T_{A_t}(\mathcal F), \qquad 
\nabla_{\dot A_t}v=\Pi_{T_{A_t}(\mathcal F)}(Dv[\dot A_t]),
```

where $\nabla$ is the connection preserving feasibility.
Curvature

```math
R(u,v)=\nabla_u\nabla_v-\nabla_v\nabla_u-\nabla_{[u,v]}
```

measures the **non-commutativity of local adaptations**—the structural tension of the system.
Stability means that motion remains nearly tangent:

```math
|\Pi_{N_{A_t}(\mathcal F)}(\dot A_t)|<\varepsilon,
```

so that the mechanism “moves by maintaining its own feasibility.”

### 2  Macro Limit – Deformation of Structure

In the macro or **deformation** limit, $\mathcal F$ is itself time-dependent.
The state variable is the distribution $\mu_t$ of feasible configurations:

```math
\partial_t \mu_t = \mathcal L[\mu_t],
```

with $\mathcal L$ a geometric generator.
Here curvature fields $R_t$ capture how constraint directions twist across the space of institutions or technologies.
This is an **infinite-dimensional flow** over the manifold of structures—growth, innovation, and obsolescence appear as changes in the geometry of feasibility.

### 3  Micro Limit – Persistence of Tension

In the micro or **ethical** limit, one studies a local chart
$\mathcal M_c\subset\mathbb R^n$ of coherent tensions $S(t)$.
The dynamics reduce to

```math
\dot S(t)=F(S(t)), \qquad S(t)\in\mathcal M_c,
```

a finite-dimensional projection describing **how constraint tension sustains itself**.
Curvature here becomes internal: not how the manifold bends, but how the agent preserves its own generative balance.
This limit defines *Generative Labor*—the ethical endpoint of constraint geometry.

### 4  Generative Duality

The two limits form a **duality of persistence and deformation**:

| Aspect                 | Macro (After Aghion and Acemoglu) | Micro (Generative Labor)         |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Object                 | $\mathcal F$ itself               | Local $S(t)$ within $\mathcal F$ |
| Dimensionality         | Infinite / functional             | Finite / local                   |
| Flow Type              | Connection–curvature field        | Vector-field ODE                 |
| Invariant              | Feasibility of structure          | Self-consistency of tension      |
| Ethical Interpretation | System maintains viability        | Agent maintains generativity     |

Duality persists in the generative phase not as opposition but as **co-immanence**:
$(S,\nabla S)$ coexist; structure and its derivative are inseparable.
The generative condition is

```math
\nabla_S(\nabla S)\in T_S(\mathcal M_c),
```

meaning the derivative of generation remains feasible within its own geometry.

| Macro | $(\mathcal F,\nabla,R)$    | Infinite-dimensional manifold | Dynamic constraint geometry    |
