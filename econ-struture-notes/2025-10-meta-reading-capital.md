## 1. The Epistemic Structure of *Capital I*

The first volume of *Capital* operates as a **self-contained epistemic system**.  
Starting from the commodity form, Marx reconstructs the logic of capital accumulation through formal deduction — what may be called a **reflexive formalism**.

This logic functions like a *proof by contradiction*:  
by assuming equality in exchange, it demonstrates how inequality (surplus value) emerges within the system’s internal consistency.

Formally:

- **Assumption:** equivalence of exchange (value = socially necessary labor time)  
- **Inference:** exploitation arises not from exchange, but from production  
- **Outcome:** the self-expansion of capital ($M–C–M′$) as a lawful necessity  

At this stage, *Capital* remains **a dialectical logic of forms**, not an empirical model.  
It is internally closed and methodologically rigorous.

## 2. The Collapse of Abstract Logic in *Capital II*

When Marx attempts to extend this logic to **the circulation of total social capital**,  
the epistemic ground shifts.

The first volume’s logic is *object-logic* (relations among commodities);  
the second volume deals with *relation-logic* (relations among relations — circulation, turnover, reproduction).  
These belong to **different ontological strata**.

Marx himself realized this.  
In his late notes he writes that the economist now confronts “not things, but the social forms of relations themselves.”  
This signals a shift from **scientific abstraction** to **systemic representation**,  
and hence a methodological impasse.

The “reproduction schemes” in Volume II are not proof but simulation —  
they describe the *conditions for system continuity*, not the *logic of contradiction*.  
Dialectical motion gives way to systemic balance.

## 3. Systemic Closure and the Illusion of Conservation in *Capital III*

Volume III introduces the conversion of value into production prices.  
Here Marx tries to preserve the **law of value** under complex inter-sectoral competition.  
The result is a tension he cannot resolve:

- Total value = total production price  
- Total surplus value = total profit  

These equalities are not empirical truths but **axiomatic constraints** to save the earlier logic.  
The system becomes self-referential:  
a closed economy of concepts preserving itself under apparent transformation.

Marx is forced to **trade dialectical openness for systemic coherence**.  
The “average rate of profit” functions as a *closure operator*,  
making the model consistent but no longer explanatory.

Thus, Volume III is not the completion of *Capital*,  
but its **epistemic inversion** — from critique to conservation.

## 4. From Dialectic to Meta-Structure: The Recognition of Limits

Late Marx was fully aware of this methodological fracture.  
His correspondence calls the later volumes “the chaotic forms” —  
an acknowledgment that his own method had reached its limit.  

He could have stopped at Volume I,  
producing a self-sufficient dialectical critique of capital’s form.  
But he needed to show that **logic is also history**,  
that the movement of thought corresponds to the movement of reality.

The attempt to unify them collapses precisely because it succeeds logically:  
once the system explains its own reproduction,  
contradiction becomes description, and critique becomes closure.

In that sense, the incompleteness of *Capital* is its truth.  
The failure of dialectics to pass into system is the dialectical result itself.

## 5. Epilogue — On Understanding Without Reading

To *understand Marx without reading him* is not ignorance.  
It is an epistemic completion:  
to recognize that *Capital* is not a collection of theses,  
but a **machine for generating and exhausting its own logic**.

Grasping that machine — its premises, reversals, and collapse —  
is to “read” Marx at the level he most desired:  
not as doctrine, but as **the practice of thinking through contradiction**.
