# Econ-Structure Notes

This folder collects structural reflections on economic theory from within the discipline’s formal grammar.  
It serves as an **interface layer** between microeconomic modeling and post-disciplinary system analysis.

Each note reinterprets a classical concept—utility, information, participation, or labor—  
through the lens of **constraint geometry, dynamic feasibility, and structural stability**.  
The writing is analytical rather than empirical: its aim is to expose the internal mechanics of rational systems  
and to identify where classical equilibrium logic begins to fold under higher-order generative constraints.

The tone remains *within economics*, but the orientation is **trans-structural**:  
rethinking the mathematical core of incentive and information theories  
without resorting to sociological or narrative extensions.

### Position in the Repository

- **projects/** → constructive modeling and mechanism formulation.  
- **econ-structure-notes/** → theoretical and structural reflections that clarify or precede those models.  
- **philosophical-structure-notes/** → cross-disciplinary synthesis beyond economics as a closed system.

Each note may serve as a “conceptual bridge” toward formal work,  
documenting the **translation from philosophical structure to economic mechanism**.
