# Econ-Structure Notes

This folder collects structural reflections on economic theory from within the discipline’s formal grammar.  
It serves as an **interface layer** between microeconomic modeling and post-disciplinary system analysis.

Each note reinterprets a classical concept—utility, information, participation, or labor—  
through the lens of **constraint geometry, dynamic feasibility, and structural stability**.  
The writing is analytical rather than empirical: its aim is to expose the internal mechanics of rational systems  
and to identify where classical equilibrium logic begins to fold under higher-order generative constraints.

The tone remains *within economics*, but the orientation is **trans-structural**:  
rethinking the mathematical core of incentive and information theories  
without resorting to sociological or narrative extensions.

### Ethical Temporality and Structural Boundary

While the *econ-structure* layer operates strictly within the discipline’s formal grammar,  
its closure is **temporal rather than absolute**.  
The decision to remain inside constraint geometry—  
to treat feasibility, stability, and incentive compatibility as self-contained principles—  
is not a denial of ethics, but a **discipline of form**.

Ethics, in this framework, is suspended inside the system as *structural self-consistency*:  
the refusal to appeal to external justification until the internal geometry has completed its cycle.  
Only once closure has been achieved can exposure occur—  
when the structure begins to articulate the curvature of its own limits.

This temporal rhythm defines the interface between  
**econ-structure** (closure of form) and **narrative-generative** (exposure of form).  
The first maintains coherence; the second bears its failure.  
Together they trace the recursive ethics of system and rupture.

### Position in the Repository

- **projects/** → constructive modeling and mechanism formulation.  
- **econ-structure-notes/** → theoretical and structural reflections that clarify or precede those models.  
- **philosophical-structure-notes/** → cross-disciplinary synthesis beyond economics as a closed system.

Each note may serve as a “conceptual bridge” toward formal work,  
documenting the **translation from philosophical structure to economic mechanism**.
